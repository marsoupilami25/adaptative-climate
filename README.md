# Adaptative Climate

Home Assistant custom integration for adaptative climate entities.

## Structure

```text
custom_components/
  adaptative_climate/
    __init__.py
    climate.py
    config_flow.py
    const.py
    coordinator.py
    manifest.json
    strings.json
    translations/
      en.json
      fr.json
```

## Installation

Copy `custom_components/adaptative_climate` into the `custom_components`
directory of your Home Assistant configuration, then restart Home Assistant.

After restart, add the integration from:

```text
Settings > Devices & services > Add integration > Adaptative Climate
```

The first implementation creates one `climate` entity that wraps an existing
`climate` entity and forwards the main commands to it.
